# Milestone 2
This is the second milestone of the project where I scape data from Wikipedia   
and Google News to create my database.  
## To run the code run the following commands:  
`sudo apt install python3.8-venv`  
Then create a virtual environment using the following command:  
`python3 -m venv Myenv`  
Now, activate this environment using:  
`source Myenv/bin/activate`  
One last step before running the program is to install the requirements using:  
`pip install requirements.txt`  
Then run the code using:  
`python3 main.py`
